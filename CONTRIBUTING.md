Thank you for contributing to o2tk (the oxygen toolkit).  

If you are creating issues or merge requests please use the templates provided.

For merge requests, we do use rustfmt, so please make sure it adheres to that codestyle, otherwise the build will fail. Also, please use clippy for linting to catch any bad practices.
